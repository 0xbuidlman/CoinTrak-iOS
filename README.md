[Website](http://cointrak.me)

**CoinTrak**'s iOS version is in the early beta stages of development as of 8/10, and hopes to have an App Store launch by the end of 2016.

**Note:** I myself have used 100% swift when coding this project, but some of the libraries that i am using are large and only in Objective-C, hence the majority of the code in the repository being Objective-C
